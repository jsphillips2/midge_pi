\section*{Scientific significance statement}

Light limitation of benthic primary production is an important determinant of 
ecosystem metabolism of shallow lakes.
Organisms that alter the physical structure of the benthos have great potential 
to shape the light limitation of benthic primary producers,
however the extent of these effects is poorly understood.
Through a field experiment, I show how tube-building 
macroinvertebrates alter different aspects of benthic photosynthesis-light relationships
in a shallow eutrophic lake, 
with especially strong enhancement of primary production under light-limiting conditions. 
This in turn reduces the threshold light levels for half-saturated production
below the light levels observed during a thick cyanobacterial bloom.
These results illustrate how benthic structure can alleviate light limitation 
of shallow lakes in the face of variable water clarity.
